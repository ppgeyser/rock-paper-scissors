# train-schedule
This Journey themed train scheduling app is my fifth project for the UCSD Full Stack Web Developer Bootcamp. This project showcases my understanding of Firebase and MomentJS.

In this app, the user plays the role of a train administrator that is in charge of creating train schedules. By submitting the train name, destination, time the first train runs, and the train's frequency, the app then is able to calculate when the next train is due to arrive, and how many minutes away said train is.

The database that stores all of the train information is in firebase, and thus the data persists across different browsing sessions, and multiple people are able to update the train schedule at the same time.
